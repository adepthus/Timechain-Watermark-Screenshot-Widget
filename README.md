# Timechain Watermark Screenshot Widget

A minimalist desktop widget for capturing tamper-proof screenshots, videos, and GIFs with blockchain-based timestamps and customizable watermarks. Designed for authenticity and integrity in digital proof-keeping, ideal for legal, compliance, or personal documentation needs.

# Features

Tamper-Resistant Proofs: Embeds real-time blockchain data (Bitcoin block height, hash) and Swatch Internet Time in captures.
Customizable Watermarks: Add user-defined text, time, and blockchain info with adjustable styles (centered or grid: 3, 5, or 8 watermarks).
Capture Modes:

- Screenshots (.png) with embedded metadata.

- Videos (.mp4/.avi, configurable duration, default 10s).

- GIFs (.gif, configurable duration, default 7s).

Global Hotkeys: PrintScreen: Capture screenshot.

- F9: Record video.
- F10: Record GIF.

Cross-Platform: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Bilingual: English and Polish language support.

Enhanced Watermarking: Improved grid-based watermark placement (styles 3, 5, 8) with reduced opacity (75%) and font size (30).

File Naming: Structured as TimechainProof(YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)-prompt @ full_hash.ext.
